# Hello_GitHub
- This is my first repository in GitHub, I will deal with MNIST dataset with ML&DL
- created by Daibiao Wu in 9-25-2023
## Original Dataset
- MNIST is a classic data set in the field of machine learning and deep learning. There are many methods for this data set. Here are some methods for reference.  
- the data resource is [kaggle Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview)
- [train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCDhH0PNpBu0Az-O2Fx96k6BSU40ej9W/view?usp=drive_link)
- [test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CC7AHQz4qoVbaxgrNbUB-MVCqQsaTluR/view?usp=drive_link)
## ~~Datasets~~
- This dataset is used for model training and testing
- Remove instantaneous values
- Determine the size of the data set
## Models
- ML
  - support vector machine (SVM)
  - decision tree (DT)
  - random forest (RF)
  - Bayesian network (BN)
  - k-nearest-neighbor (KNN)
  - logistic regression (LR)
- DL
  - neural network (NN)
  - long short-term memory networks (LSTM)
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Broad Learning System (BLS)
